Java API for GitHub

See http://github-api.kohsuke.org/ for more details

The SourceClear fork of this project contains updates to enable org-level
webhook functionality.

See: https://github.com/kohsuke/github-api/pull/192

Note that we are branched off of the latest release tag 1.68 because the
current master (1.69-SNAPSHOT) in this project is critically broken.
